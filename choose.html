    The term "sadist" in popular usage describes one who obtains pleasure from indiscriminate
brutality. Actually, though, a true sadist is selective. He carefully chooses from the vast reserve of
appropriate victims, and takes great delight in giving those who thrive on misery the fulfillment of
their desires. The "well-adjusted" sadist is epicurean in selecting those on whom his energies will
be well-spent! If a person is healthy enough to admit he is a masochist and enjoys being enslaved
and whipped, the real sadist is glad to oblige!
